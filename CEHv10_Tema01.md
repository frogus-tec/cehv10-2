# MODULE 1 - Introduction to Ethical Hacking

## Information Security Overview

### Terminology

**Hack Value**: Is the notion among hackers to evaluate something that is worth doing or is insterenting. 

**Vulnerability**: Is the existence of weakness, desing, or an implementing error that, when exploited, leads to an unexpected and undesirable event compromising the security of the system.

**Exploit**: Is a breach of IT system security through vulnerabilities, in the context of an attack on a system or network. It also refers to mailicious softw. or commands that can cause unanticipated behavior of legitimate softw. or hardw. through attackers taking advantage of the vulnerabilities.

**Payload**: Is the part of a malware or an exploit code that performs the intended mailicious actions, which can include creating backdoor access to a viticm's machine, damaging or deleting files, commiting data theft and hijacking computer. 

**Zero-Day Attack**: The attacker exploits vulnerabilities in a computer application before the softw. developer can release a patch for then.

**Daisy Chaining**: It invloves gaining access to one network and/or computer and then using the same information to gain access to multiple networks and computers that contain desirable information.

**Doxing**: Refers to gathering and publishing personally idntifiable information such as an individual's name and email address, or other sensitive information pertaining to an entire organization.

**Bot**: Softw. application or program that can be controlled remotely to execute or automate predefined tasks.

### Elements of Information Security

**Information Security** is defined as *"a state of well-being of inforation and infrastructure in which the possibility of theft, tampering, and disruption of information and services is kept low or tolerable"*. It relies on five major elements: confidentiality, integrity, availability, authenticity, and non-repudiation.

* **Confidentiality** Is the assurance that the information is accesible only to those who are authorized to have access. Confidentiality breaches may occur due to improper data handling or a hacking attempt. Confidentiality controls include data classification, data encryption, and proper equipment disposal.
* **Integrity** Is the trustworthiness of data or resources in the prevention of improper and unauthorized changes - the assurance that information is sufficiently accurate for its purpose. Measures to maintian data integrity may include a checksum and access control.
* **Availability** Is the assurance that the systems responsible for delivering, storing, and processing information are accesible when reaquired by authorized users. Measures to maintain data availability can include redundant systems disk arrays and clustered machines, antivirus softw. to stop malware from destroying networks, and DDoS prevention systems.
* **Authenticity** Refers to the characteristic of a communication, document, or any data that ensures the quality of being genuine or uncorrupted. The major role of authentication is to confirm that a user is genuine, one who he/she claims to be. Controls such as biometrics, smart cards, and digital certificates ensure the authenticity of data, transactions, communications, or documents.
* **Non-Repudation** Is a way to guarantee that the sender of a message cannot later deny having sent the message, and that the recipient cannot deny having received the message. Individuals and organization use digital signatures to ensure non-repudation.

### The Security, Functionality, and Usability Triangle

Level of security in any system can be defined by the strength of three components:

* **Functionality**: The set of features providen by the system.
* **Usability**: The GUI components used to design the system for ease of use.
* **Security**: Restrictions imposed on accessing the components of the system.

The relationship between these three components is demonstrated by using a triangle because increase or decrease in any one of the component automatically affects the other two components.

For example, increased security and decreased Functionality and Usability.
